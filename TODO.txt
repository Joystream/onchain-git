# TODOs

## Write Pushed Git Data to Cosmos Store
1. helper: Receive request to list refs from Git
2. helper: Send request to gitservicecli to query refs in repo, chain ID being the first component
  of the URL
3. cli: Get refs in remote repo - create repo if it doesn't exist
4. cli: Write refs to terminal
5. helper: Read refs from cli output
6. helper: Write refs to terminal
7. helper: Receive request to push refs to remote
8. helper: Send request to gitservicecli to write refs to repo, chain ID being the first URL
  component
9. cli: Create a go-git repository object for the remote
10. cli: Add a go-git remote pointing to the local repository to the remote repository
11. cli: Have remote object (pointing to local repo) fetch refs into remote repo;
11. server: Write refs/corresponding data to blockchain

Client must tell server to store data. How do we get the data to the server? Stream it
from local storage?

We should probably use the auth module in order to implement account handling.
